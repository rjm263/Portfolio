# Portfolio
Python package for portfolio analysis

NB: This project is work in progress...

This project will eventually become a package to analyse my portfolio of financial assets. So far different asset types can be added to a portfolio and their values and returns can be obtained. I'm currently adding a class for savings plans as well. In the near future I will add various analytics tools like VaR, ES, correlations etc. as well as forecasting and visualisation tools. Stay tuned!
