# Portfolio
Python package for portfolio analysis

NB: This project is work in progress...

This project will eventually become a package to analyse portfolios of financial assets. So far different asset types can be added to a portfolio and their value and return obtained. I'm currently adding a class for savings plans as well as various analytics tools like VaR, ES, correlations etc., forecasting and visualisation. I'm planning to integrate some AI features like chart analysis in the future. Stay tuned!
